This module enables school staff to create, maintain and view `Risk Assessments`.

Each `Risk Assessment` has an `Approver` and must be re-approved if any modifications are made or after a year has
passed since approval.

<Info>
    * `Risk Assessments` can have `Actions` assigned to any member of staff and these have associated due-dates.
    * Staff with actions are reminded as they become `Due` or `Overdue`.
</Info>

<Tip>
    Staff can confirm that they have read individual `Risk Assessments` and will be alerted if the ones they
    have confirmed are updated so that they can re-confirm.
</Tip>

## Operation

<Warning>
    All staff have access to the complete list of `Risk Assessments` unless they are marked as `confidential`. It is
    important therefore not to include personal information or to use this system to record risk assessments for
    identifiable individuals unless you ensure that the confidentiality feature is used.<br/>
</Warning>

1. `Risk assessments` are accessed from a master list which is paginated. The list can be searched and filtered using
the controls at the top. On the right hand side of the top bar are controls for adding a new `Risk Assessment` and
for filtering to just those a user has `Confirmations` for.

2. Any user can create a new `Risk Assessment` using the "+" button on the list top bar. This opens a modal where the
basic information about the risk assessment can be entered:

 - **Activity:** this is the descriptive title of the `Risk Assessment`
 - **Risk Area:** select from the categories set up by `Risk Assessment Managers`
 - **Location:** this is optional but text can be added to clarify where the activity is being carried out
 - **Owner:** by default this is set to the person creating the risk assessment but can be set to any other member of
staff as appropriate
 - **Approver:** this does not need to be set at this stage and is set to the person who approves
the `Risk Assessment`.
It can be helpful to assign at this stage if known though, so that person sees it on their list of
unapproved `Risk assessments`.
 - **At Risk:** selecting which categories of people are at risk from the activity can be helpful when filtering the
list
of risk assessments. Control measures for different groups of people can vary significantly.
 - **Additional Information:** Use this field to record specific additional information such e.g. "Statutory
Requirement"
or "See detailed externally commissioned Fire Risk Assessment"

3. Once created, a `Risk Assessment` can then be completed by finding it in the list and either clicking on it or
selecting "View" from its dropdown menu.

 > {primary} The "Edit" option in the dropdown enables the basic information input when it was created to be amended.

<Info>
    The coloured bars on the left hand side of the main list indicate the overall `Risk Level` of
    each `Risk Assessment`. <br/><br/>Note that a newly created one is colour coded grey as it has no `Hazards` assessed
    yet.
