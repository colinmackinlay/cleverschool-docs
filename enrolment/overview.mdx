## Overview

This module enables parents of students joining the school to enter and submit key enrolment information online. The
school can then import this into its Management Information System (MIS) using an ATF file.

Key benefits for the school are:

-   Streamlines the enrolment process
-   Saves time entering data into the MIS
-   Eliminates data entry errors
-   Allows the communication of key medical and educational information
-   Gathers and records key consents for use of images, local trips etc
-   Keeps a file record for school and parents of data provided

Benefits for parents are:

-   Easy to access as login can be provided using social media or traditional email and password
-   Efficient transfer of information to the school
-   Reassurance of being able to give detailed personal information about their child
-   Returns a record to them of what the school has received

### Features

* Add students individually for in-year admissions or in bulk for new intake.

* Parents receive emails to enable login and can then provide all the information you need to add them to your MIS.

* As well as importing data to your MIS through the DfE ATF protocol, additional data such as medical information can be
recorded and printed out for each student.

* Consents for trips and visits, use of images as well as biometric data can be gathered too. Use this system to gather
initial consents from parents for trips and visits as well as the use of photographs etc.
