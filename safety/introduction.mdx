## Introduction

This module enables schools to keep track of key safety checks and actions.

-   Checks are organised as separate items within common areas that can be updated individually.
-   Updates can be to either confirm the checks are complete, to update the due date of the check or to record information relevant to the check.
-   Review dates are colour coded according to whether they are overdue, due within four weeks, or further ahead.

Areas are updated by `Safety Owners` who by default are also assigned to each of the `Safety Items` in the `Safety Area`.

-   The owner of an area can, however, assign individual `Safety Items` to someone else provided they are a user of the system and that they have also been assigned the role of `Safety Owner` (or `Safety Manager`).

Users who have the role of `Safety Manager` can assign the role of `Safety Owner` to any other user of the system and can also assign ownership of all `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items`.

-   `Safety Managers` must be assigned by an `Administrator`.

There is also a role of `Safety Viewer` that can be assigned to any user of the system. These users can see the status of any `Safety Area` or `Safety Item` but cannot update them.

-   Any user who can view the Safety Audit can also print out individual or multiple areas.
-   Users with access to the Safety Audit will have a panel visible on their Dashboard that summarises the status of all the safety items in the Audit.
-   For `Safety Owners` and `Safety Managers` this panel also indicates the status of the `Safety Items` that they "own".

## Operation

All `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` are initially marked as incomplete.

-   The `Safety Owner` assigned to each will receive an email once a week to remind them of `Safety Areas` and `Safety Items` that are `Unapproved`, `Not OK` or `Overdue`.
-   They will also be reminded if these are `Due for review` within the next four weeks.

The main `Safety Audit` page, accessed from the `Dashboard` lists all the `Safety Areas` with their `Owners` and a progress indicator showing the status of the `Safety Items` in that `Safety Area`.
At the top of the page there is a button to access a list of all `Safety Items`, another one to `Print` a report of the status of all `Areas and Items` and, for managers, access to the Admin/Setup pages.

`Safety Items` can be reviewed and updated either from here or from their parent `Safety Area` page.

When marking a `Safety Item` as `OK` the `Review Date` will be updated to be one year on from the date of confirmation.

-   If, however, the `Safety Item` is `Due for review` within the next 4 weeks the date is updated to be one year from the current review date.
The intention of this is that reviews can take place in a timely way before they are due but the review date does not creep earlier and earlier each year.
-   The review date can also be updated independently if it is necessary to change the annual review cycle or to check a `Safety Item` more often.

The name of the `Safety Owner` of each `Safety Area` and `Safety Item` is displayed next to it as a "mailto" hyperlink to facilitate quick communication if any queries arise.

In a coordinated group of schools (e.g. a MAT), some `Safety Items` can only be updated by the central `Safety Owner`.
They still have locally set `Safety Owners` who will receive reminders about them so that they can be involved in the coordinated update of them.
