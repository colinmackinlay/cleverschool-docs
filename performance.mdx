## Overview

This module is also sometimes referred to as the Performance Management or Appraisal module.

The module manages an annual process where members of staff can have objectives set and reviewed in a process involving them and an appraiser.

### Objectives

Staff can have multiple objectives but usually they will have three or perhaps four. For example teachers may have a objective in each of the following areas:

* Pupil outcomes
* Teaching and Learning
* Professional Development

Leaders might have an alternative or additional "Leadership and Management" objective relating to their particular area of responsibility.

<Tip>
    It is possible to set up a number of different "Staff Types" e.g. Teacher, Head of Year, Site Staff etc. Each staff
    type can have a template objectives to speed up the process of the initial meeting.

## Process

The appraisal process has four distinct phases:

### Objective setting

Objectives are added individually or copied from the previous year or added from a template for the staff type.

* The member of staff (appraisee) would normally discuss and agree these in a meeting with the appraiser.
* Each objective must also have an entry for indicative evidence/success criteria and also for professional development needs (these can be marked as tbc or n/a if necessary).
* The appraisee and the appraiser agree the objectives on the system.

### Interim Review

* Part way through the year, the appraisee and appraiser meet to conduct an interim review.
* Either of them can enter text into the interim comment for each objective
* When each objective has an interim comment, both the appraisee and appraiser agree the interim review on the system.

### Self review
At the end of the year, the appraisee enters a self-review of each objective
When each objective has a self-review, the appraisee submits the self-review and this notifies the appraiser that it is ready for final review.

### Final review

The appraiser enters a final review comment for each objective and determines whether the objective has been:

* Met
* Partially Met
* Not Met

The appraiser adds further overall comments on:

* Professional standards
* Strengths
* Areas for development
* Summary
* The appraisee adds a final comment
* The appraiser completes the review

<Tip>
    The review can be printed at any stage and when complete, a copy is emailed to both the appraisee and appraiser.

## Confidentiality

By its very nature, appraisals are confidential documents and generally are only accessible by the appraisee and
appraiser.

However, the user or users assigned the role of "performance manager" can access all reviews unless they are marked as
"confidential".This is helpful for managing the process and quality assuring the objectives against the
school's requirements.

The appraiser can mark an individual review as confidential. If that is done, then only the appraiser and
appraisee can view it.

A whole "Staff Type" can be marked as confidential. This is useful, for example, for the appraisals of senior leaders
where they shouldn't be visible to other senior leaders who may be managers of the system.
