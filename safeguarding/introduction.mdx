## Introduction

This module enables schools to keep track of key safeguarding checks and actions.

-   Checks are organised as separate items within common areas that can be updated individually.
-   Updates can be to either confirm the checks are complete, to update the due date of the check or to record information relevant to the check.
-   Review dates are colour coded according to whether they are overdue, due within four weeks, or further ahead.

Areas are updated by `Safeguarding Owners` who by default are also assigned to each of the `Safeguarding Items` in the `Safeguarding Area`.

-   The owner of an area can, however, assign individual `Safeguarding Items` to someone else provided they are a user of the system and that they have also been assigned the role of `Safeguarding Owner` (or `Safeguarding Manager`).

Users who have the role of `Safeguarding Manager` can assign the role of `Safeguarding Owner` to any other user of the system and can also assign ownership of all `Safeguarding Areas` and `Safeguarding Items`.

-   `Safeguarding Managers` must be assigned by an `Administrator`.

There is also a role of `Safeguarding Viewer` that can be assigned to any user of the system. These users can see the status of any `Safeguarding Area` or `Safeguarding Item` but cannot update them.

-   Any user who can view the Safeguarding Audit can also print out individual or multiple areas.
-   Users with access to the Safeguarding Audit will have a panel visible on their Dashboard that summarises the status of all the safeguarding items in the Audit.
-   For `Safeguarding Owners` and `Safeguarding Managers` this panel also indicates the status of the `Safeguarding Items` that they "own".

## Operation

All `Safeguarding Areas` and `Safeguarding Items` are initially marked as incomplete.

-   The `Safeguarding Owner` assigned to each will receive an email once a week to remind them of `Safeguarding Areas` and `Safeguarding Items` that are `Unapproved`, `Not OK` or `Overdue`.
-   They will also be reminded if these are `Due for review` within the next four weeks.

The main `Safeguarding Audit` page, accessed from the `Dashboard` lists all the `Safeguarding Areas` with their `Owners` and a progress indicator showing the status of the `Safeguarding Items` in that `Safeguarding Area`.
At the top of the page there is a button to access a list of all `Safeguarding Items`, another one to `Print` a report of the status of all `Areas and Items` and, for managers, access to the Admin/Setup pages.

`Safeguarding Items` can be reviewed and updated either from here or from their parent `Safeguarding Area` page.

When marking a `Safeguarding Item` as `OK` the `Review Date` will be updated to be one year on from the date of confirmation.

-   If, however, the `Safeguarding Item` is `Due for review` within the next 4 weeks the date is updated to be one year from the current review date.
The intention of this is that reviews can take place in a timely way before they are due but the review date does not creep earlier and earlier each year.
-   The review date can also be updated independently if it is necessary to change the annual review cycle or to check a `Safeguarding Item` more often.

The name of the `Safeguarding Owner` of each `Safeguarding Area` and `Safeguarding Item` is displayed next to it as a "mailto" hyperlink to facilitate quick communication if any queries arise.

In a coordinated group of schools (e.g. a MAT), some `Safeguarding Items` can only be updated by the central `Safeguarding Owner`.
They still have locally set `Safeguarding Owners` who will receive reminders about them so that they can be involved in the coordinated update of them.
